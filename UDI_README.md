# UDI Compliance under FDA

## UDI Certification with FDA

Unique Device Identification (UDI) is a system established by the FDA to identify and track medical devices through distribution and use. For companies like Medline and Walgreens, UDI "certification" is not a separate approval process but a mandatory requirement for each device they distribute.

The primary responsibility for UDI compliance falls on the device labeler, who is typically the manufacturer but can also be a repackager or relabeler. For distributors like Medline and Walgreens, UDI requirements are handled through three key components:

1. **Ensuring products from their manufacturers are compliant**
2. **Registering their facilities**
3. **Maintaining accurate records**
