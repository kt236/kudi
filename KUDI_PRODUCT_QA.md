# KUDI Product Q&A

## What types of medical devices or products will KUDI support?
KUDI will initially support Class II devices (Moderate risk) and is designed with plans to extend to other device categories in the future.

## What workflows or integrations are required?
KUDI will integrate with the FDA GUDID (Global Unique Device Identification Database) for automated data submission and validation. If device specifications change due to customer feedback, KUDI will ensure that the updated specifications are promptly reflected in the GUDID database. Integration with manufacturer and distributor systems is also planned to ensure end-to-end compliance.

## What user roles and permissions are needed?
KUDI is intended for use by medical device manufacturers, distributors (e.g., Medline, Walgreens), and repackagers or relabelers. User roles may include admin, manufacturer, distributor, and compliance officer, each with appropriate permissions for their responsibilities.

## What is the preferred technology stack for frontend and backend?
KUDI will use the contents of the C:\kinvest codebase to build both frontend and backend components, leveraging existing resources for rapid development.

## Are there any UI/UX preferences or must-have dashboard features?
KUDI will provide compliance dashboards and reporting, secure record storage, and audit trails. The UI/UX will focus on ease of use for managing UDI labels, tracking device information, and supporting regulatory workflows.

## How will KUDI handle UDI label claims?
KUDI will verify that the claims on the UDI label are valid and accurate, and will apply the correct claims based on device and regulatory requirements.

## How will KUDI handle updates to device specifications?
If device specifications change due to customer feedback, KUDI will ensure that the updated specifications are promptly reflected in the GUDID database and all relevant records.
